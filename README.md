# Shattered Sky Social App

This is the codebase for the Shattered Sky Social app, downstream from Catsky, which is forked from the **original Bluesky Social app.**

Of particular note, this fork has some adjustments made for using an alternative AppView that extend beyond adjusting environment variables.

Intended for use to develop against the [@parakeet.at](https://tangled.org/@parakeet.at/parakeet) Rust-based AppView.

## Development Resources

See [README.bk.md](README.bk.md).


## Forking guidelines

We have the blessing to fork this application, and try to be clear to users we are giving them a fork.

We have tried to:

- Change all branding in the repository and UI to clearly differentiate from Bluesky.
- Change any support links (feedback, email, terms of service, etc) to my own systems.
- Replace any analytics or error-collection systems with my own.
